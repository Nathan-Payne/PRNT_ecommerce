# PRNT_ecommerce
Refactoring an e-commerce app from "The Modern Javascript Bootcamp" 2019 [**found here**](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-beginners-complete-tutorial/).

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Node.js

## Purpose
The purpose here was to develop a deeper understanding of vanilla javascript including the newer features introduced with ES6+ and also solidfy HTML and CSS practises. The changes made in this repo update the HTML and CSS to use a mobile first responsive design, they are a first draft toward a more unique e-commerce store. This required additional routes in the node backend as well as client side javascript (e.g. filtering images pulled from a database). 

The app itself was built alongside a curriculum which included use of promises/asynchronus javascript, connecting to + parsing responses from API's, command line tools, javascript classes, authentication and form validation.

## Timespan
This project was worked on part-time for about a week

## Potential future expansion
- Integrating the Stripe API
- responsive above 4k resolution across all browsers
- meeting accessibility/SEO standards in HTML
